# SportPsychTool

## Description
This web application was developed in collaboration with Elizabeth Mati and Monique Faleafa; clinical psychologists based in Auckland, New Zealand. A user-friendly interface was required to quickly summarise psychometric testing data gathered from sporting participants via Survey Monkey. The participants were athletes in a mainstream sporting league in Australasia. The aim of the survey was to assess the athleteâ€™s mental health, wellbeing, coping ability, and personal attributes. Each athlete was required to complete the survey in full. The survey deployed multiple metrices with multiple questions nested within each category of measure. This web application automatically cleans and processes the raw data (exported from Survey Monkey), and then combines multiple responses to obtain an aggregate score for each category of measure. Clinically significant thresholds were implemented and presented visually in the interface. Group summary data is provided. Analysts can traceback to the original question and its given response.

Note: Details regarding the client is purposely obscured for privacy. The sample dataset is fictitious and does not contain information from real athletes.
